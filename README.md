# Information
"MSH" (Minishell, Minimalistic Shell) is a LFS-based Linux Distro made to directly run in the kernel.
The minimalistic shell distro can be used for various reasons:
* Developing modules
* Developing distros (Yes, you can use our software to build distros!)
* Developing programs
* Binding code to the kernel (DIRECTLY!)
